# Assignment 5
If you have any questions, come to Office Hours on Wednesday from 7-9pm at the Link *or* post on Lore and we'll answer them there.

## The Only Part
Your job in this assignment is to take `input.json` and turn it into `output.json`. You will do this by filling in the function (and, perhaps, creating some helpful objects/functions) called getConnections in `main.js`. 

As you are coding, you can test what you've written by running `index.html` and pressing the 'Process Data' button. This will reveal what you have right and wrong so far in your code in the console, while printing your result to the screen.

In `input.json`, you are handed an array of friends and their likes, much like in the previous assignment. In this one, however, your job is to create a representation of the graph of the common likes between friends and output that representation. One possible way of doing this would be to represent friends and edges between those friends.

Happy coding!
