## The Version Control Part

## The Team Part
1. Select a team of 3-4 people in total. 
2. Ping us and confirm that your team is of the right size.

**NOTE:** There can only be two teams of 3 and two teams of 4, so the work load is evenly spread out.

## The Project Management Part
1. Please register for [Trello](https://trello.com/kirillklimuk/recommend).
2. Create a board that has your entire team on it.
3. Use this board to complete the programming assignment.

## The Programming Part
You've now learned quite a lot about the nature of JavaScript. So now, we'd like you to build a text editor. Here is the spec for the text editor:

- Load/store text documents.
- Write text documents.
- Text documents should have the following metadata:
	+ Title
	+ Date modified
	+ Date created
	+ An array of tags
- Show a list of all available text documents.
	+ The documents should be listed in order of recency (by date modified).
- Show tags related to the text documents.
- Implements keyboard shortcuts for loading documents to edit.
- Implements an auto-save feature for text documents so that the data is never lost.
- gd and replace functionality.
- Looks presentable and usable, with sematically structured with HTML and styled CSS.

You're working on this with your team. So take advantage of Trello for project management. And, as a matter of course, create a GitHub repository and use git for version control.

Oh, and all of this should be written in vanilla JS (no Angularjs or jQuery allowed).

Have fun!
