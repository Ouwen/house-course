# Assignment 1
If you have any questions, come to Office Hours on Wednesday from 7-9pm at the Link *or* post on Lore and we'll answer them there.

## Part 1
Please put together an HTML portfolio of your work with the following features:

- a list of your educational/professional history
	- location, dates, and descriptions
- an image of you, suitably sized
- a paragraph of personal backstory (`lorem ipsum` is okay, too)
- links to your social media profiles

Your HTML should be:

- Semantic: 
	- [use appropriate tags for purpose at hand](joshduck.com/periodic-table.html)
- Properly structured:
	- `html` > (`head` + `body`)
	- a declared doctype (we're using HTML5)

Save the portfolio as `portfolio.html`.

At the end, you will receive a code.
Save the code as `code.txt`.
